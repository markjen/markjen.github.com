{{ page.title }}
================

My [namesake domain](http://markjen.com) has been pointed to a tumblr for a long time. However, I thought it was time for a change and found [github pages](http://pages.github.com). I'm interested to see if this makes it easier for me to jot down my thoughts since:

1. Creating posts is as simple as creating a new file and writing markdown.
2. Tracking changes and pushing updates is done via git.
3. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) provides a nice local preview system that works while disconnected from the internet.

We'll see in a few months if this iteration of my website has really taken off, or is just as dead as the rest of them.
